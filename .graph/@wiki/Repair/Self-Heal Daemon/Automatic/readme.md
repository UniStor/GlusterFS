"Triggering Self-Heal on Replicate
In replicate module, previously you had to manually trigger a self-heal when a brick goes offline and comes back online, to bring all the replicas in sync. Now the pro-active self-heal daemon runs in the background, diagnoses issues and automatically initiates self-healing every 10 minutes on the files which requireshealing."
