## Replace with a New Node
*Safe to use on Personal Data volumes - and a lot simpler!*
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.4/html/administration_guide/sect-replacing_hosts


## Blacklist: Replace Inplace (with Same Hostname)
*This is Too Complex! Do NOT Do this, for volumes containing Personal Data!*

'''You can replace a failed host with another node having the same FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). A host in a Red Hat Gluster Storage Trusted Storage Pool has its own identity called the UUID generated by the glusterFS Management Daemon.The UUID for the host is available in /var/lib/glusterd/glusterd.info file.
In the following example, the host with the FQDN as server0.example.com was irrecoverable and must to be replaced with a host, having the same FQDN. The following steps have to be performed on the new host.'''
