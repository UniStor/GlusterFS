# This library is designed so that each step is Independent & idempotent. Enabling Reuse in other Gluster configuration!

- hosts: nodes
  gather_facts: true
  vars:
    use_lvm: false
    filesystem: "btrfs"

  roles:
  # - cluster
  # - Gluster/install
  # - Storage cluster
  # - Volume/directory


## Todo: Top and bottom `vars: filesystem` has to Match! This is a problem with Global Variables at the moment.

- hosts: single
  vars:
    filesystem: "btrfs"
  roles:
  # - Gluster/peer
  - Volume/create/simple volume

# - hosts: client
#   roles:
#   - client/mount
